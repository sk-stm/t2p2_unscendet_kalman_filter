# Unscented Kalman Filter Project
## Build
I modified the _CMakeLists.txt_ such that I don't have to install the uws-library with sudo, I rather just link specifically to its location on my system. You should just restore the original file to make it compile on your system again.

## NIS
Lessons, Git template, Simulator, Readmes, rubics etc. seem out of sync. It would be nice to have consistent assignment requirements. E.g. You demand to check the consistency with NIS, but removed the code for that half a year ago. I plotted it anyway, see the `output_data dir`. 

Further, I guess we're not tracking a bicycle (as mentioned in the lesson), but a car?
